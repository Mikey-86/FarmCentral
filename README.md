An ASP.NET app that allows farmers to add new products and employees to create new users or view farmer products.

This was an assignment for my programming class in third year. I wanted to challenge myself and implment new concepts that I was not as skilled in from second year in this assignmment. I learnt futher security measures through salting and hashing passwords and then also using entity framework to structure the application.
